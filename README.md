Implementation of huffman coding IN C++
Compression is converting the large files into small size text files.Here , we have used huffman coding to convert the large size files into small size files.
Huffman coding uses the idea of representing the most repeating characters with the least number of bytes and least repeating characters with the large number of 
bytes that decreases the overall size of the file.
